# FlexPos-Extension
Simple Chrome extension example made for POS machines at my current employment. Simply sets the new chrome tab wallpaper / page and links to our online admin panel. It is excessively documented for anyone wanting to learn.

Extensions can be loaded in unpacked mode by following the following steps:

1 - Visit chrome://extensions (via omnibox or menu -> Tools -> Extensions).

2 - Enable Developer mode by ticking the checkbox in the upper-right corner.

3 - Click on the "Load unpacked extension..." button.

4 - Select the directory containing your unpacked extension.
